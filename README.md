# c_renderer
custom c renderer (almost) from scratch

This is a always work in progress repo. The goal is to develop a practical base for working with 3D in general. 
This does not mean a full general engine, just lots of programable pieces that can be eventually used for something practical.

Files are organized in the single header file style of the wonderful stb libraries. This is mostly for personal comfort as constant switching between .h and .c files makes my life more difficult than it should be.

It includes allocators, templated arrays, practical hash tables, strong emphasis on debugging features, some common algorhitms and basic PBR setup.
